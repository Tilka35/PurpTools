# PurpTools
 
This is a collection of tools and a sort of roadmap of my coding practice and challenging myself to develop tools that can benefit the open-source community.
Find a variation of Blue and Red Team based tools in this repository.

Just in case, I take no responsibility for the misuse of any of the tools that are found to have been used for malicious purposes or from malpractice. My intent is to provide education and for this collection to pose as a showcase of my coding ability.

Use these tools at your own discretion and ensure you are always following strict security practices and have written permission before using these tools on networks or devices THAT ARE NOT YOUR OWN!

Most tools are a work-in-progress, and I am to improve on them as I continue to develop my skills and their functionality.

I am making an honest commitment not to engage in vibe coding for the purpose of my learning, rather using LLMs for best practices, understanding and methodologies. I appreciate constructive criticism and feedback :)
